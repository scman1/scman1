Hi, I’m Abraham Nieva de la Hidalga (@scman1). Currently, I am collaborating as a research associate at the UK Catalysis Hub (Chemistry) in the design and development of the Catalysis Data Infrastructure and the Catalysis Research Workbench.

I’m interested in development of research infrastructures. I have worked in projects supporting Biodiversity Research (BioVeL), Natural History 
Collections Digitisation (ICEDIG), Chemistry (UPP-Portal) and Research Infrastructures (ENVRIplus).

I’m learning and applying programming languanges and software engineering practices to support researchers in different areas. My most recent projects have included learning about chemistry data processing and analysis (UK Catalysis Hub), semantic image segmentation (ICEDIG),  Reference Model of Open Distributed Processing RM-ODP (ENVRIplus).

I’m looking to collaborate on computer science research on tools and platforms for e-Science, Data Science and applied AI.
