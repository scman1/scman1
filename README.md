- 👋 Hi, I’m @scman1 (Abraham Nieva). Currently, I am collaborating as a research associate at the UK Catalysis Hub (Chemistry) in the design and development of the Catalysis Data 
Infrastructure and the Catalysis Research Workbench.
- 👀 I’m interested in development of research infrastructures. I have worked in projects supporting Biodiversity Research (BioVeL), Natural History 
Collections Digitisation (ICEDIG), Chemistry (UPP-Portal) and Research Infrastructures (ENVRIplus).
- 🌱 I’m intrested in constantly learning and applying programming languanges and software engineering practices. My most recent projects have included learning about
spectroscopy data processing (UK Catalysis Hub), semantic image segmentation ([ICEDIG](https://github.com/scman1/semantic-segmentation)),  Reference Model of Open Distributed Processing RM-ODP (ENVRIplus).
- 💞️ I’m looking to collaborate on computers science research on tools and platforms for e-Science, Data Science and applied AI.
